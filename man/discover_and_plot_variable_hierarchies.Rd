\title{Find the relationship between the variables in a data set and plot them}
\usage{
discover_and_plot_variable_hierarchies(data, n = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data.frame containing the observations and variables to inspect}

\item{n}{the number of networks to consider and compare}
}
\value{
a character matrix with columns from and to representing the variables that are related
}
\description{
Finds the hirarchical relationship between all variables and connects them in a network such as
to optimize the mutual information. This also compares the n networks found graphically.
