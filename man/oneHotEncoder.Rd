\title{Encode a vector into a one hot data.frame}
\usage{
oneHotEncoder(x, f = function(y) y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the vector to convert to a one hot}

\item{f}{a function to apply to x before encoding which defaults to identity}
}
\value{
the one hot encoded data.frame with the original data given in a Data column
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of items and onehot encodes them into a data.frame
which in reality is a tibble. Every unique value of the vector get converted into
a column and the value is 1 for that column if the row number matches the position
in the original vector. See the examples for details.
