\title{Save a single CSV-table into a single table sqlite database}
\usage{
csvToSQLite(
  csv_file,
  sqlite_file,
  table_name,
  pre_process_size = 1000,
  chunk_size = 50000,
  delim = ","
)
}
\arguments{
\item{csv_file}{name of the CSV file to convert}

\item{sqlite_file}{name of the newly created sqlite file}

\item{table_name}{name of the table to store the data table in the sqlite dbase}

\item{pre_process_size}{the number of lines to check the data types of the individual columns (default 1000)}

\item{delim}{the field delimiter to use (default ,)}

\description{
This function is useful for taking huge CSV files that do not fit into RAM
and store them as a SQLite db which can be streamed via dplyr. This way you
can work with really big data files without being limited by your machines RAM.

\examples{
library(RSQLite)
library(dplyr)
sqlite_file <- "example.sqlite"
table_name <- "example"
write.csv(airquality, "example.csv", row.names=FALSE)
csvToSQLite("example.csv", sqlite_file, table_name,
              pre_process_size = 1000, chunk_size = 50000)
mydb <- src_sqlite(sqlite_file, create = FALSE)
mydata <- tbl(mydb, table_name)
head(mydata)
